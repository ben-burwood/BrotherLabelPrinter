# Brother Printer

API and GUI for Brother PTP-700 Label Printer

This Repo is a Wrapper for and uses my Fork (https://github.com/benbur98/BrotherP700USBControl) of labelprinterkit (https://github.com/ogelpre/labelprinterkit) for Interfacing the Printer.

# Print Settings

Labels MUST use the full pixel/points PrintArea for the given Media.
e.g. the 12mm has 70 pixel/points so the content (Text) MUST fill the 70 pixel/points.
